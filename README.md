A react app allows users to set their desired wake up time. When they select the go to sleep option, the wearable hardware unit will deliver relaxing high-frequency electric pulses to the wearer's upper back. Within ten minutes or when the user's heart rate / heart rate variability fall to a sleep level, those electric pulses will stop. At the wake up time, a low frequency pulse will jolt the user's arm/fingers into movement, such that the user slaps themselves awake.
